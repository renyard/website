On 3rd July 2015, I gave a conference talk, along with [Andrea Fassina](http://www.walkabout.xyz) at the [ARM's Embedded HTML5 Workshop](http://malideveloper.arm.com/engage-with-mali/events/arms-html5-workshop/) at [DTG](http://www.dtg.org.uk/) in Vauxhall, London.

In the presentation, Andrea explained our approach to securely enabling app development on production set top boxes at [YouView](http://www.youview.com) and an investigation into the performance of various Javascript libraries and frameworks on YouView devices. I then talked through the findings of our investigation into speeding up the launch times of HTML5 apps on the platform and gave some general best practices for app development.
