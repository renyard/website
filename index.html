<h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3 class="display-4">YouView</h3>
    <h4 class="display-5">Senior Technologist</h4>
    <p class="lead">Worked as part of a team providing developer relations to third party content partners and supporting internal platform development. Researched and provided best practice recommendations to internal and external teams and engaged with internal teams to improve the app development workflow.</p>
    <p class="lead">Lead investigations into performance improvements of several HTML5 apps on the platform and in development. This resulted in a 17% improvement in loading time for one app as well as improved responsiveness in the user interface. In another example, I worked to diagnose several app and platform issues causing the app to crash or preventing video playback. Prototypes were fed back to the development team to fix these issues which dramatically improved memory usage, without which the app could not have launched.</p>
